## üöÄ Production Deployment

### When You're Ready to Go Live:

1. **Get Live Stripe Keys**
   - [ ] Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys (remove `/test`)
   - [ ] Copy your live "Secret key" (starts with `sk_live_`)

2. **Verify Your Domain in SendGrid** (Recommended)
   - [ ] Go to https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/sender_auth
   - [ ] Click "Verify a Domain"
   - [ ] Follow instructions to add DNS records
   - [ ] Use `noreply@yourdomain.com` as FROM_EMAIL

3. **Configure Netlify Environment Variables**
   - [ ] Go to your Netlify dashboard
   - [ ] Select your site
   - [ ] Go to: Site settings ‚Üí Environment variables
   - [ ] Add these variables:
     - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` = your live key (sk_live_...)
     - `SENDGRID_API_KEY` = your production key
     - `FROM_EMAIL` = noreply@yourdomain.com
     - `URL` = https://yoursite.com

4. **Deploy**
   - [ ] Commit your changes: `git add . && git commit -m "Add magic link paywall"`
   - [ ] Push to Netlify: `git push origin master`
   - [ ] Wait for build to complete

5. **Test in Production**
   - [ ] Use a REAL credit card (small amount to test)
   - [ ] Complete a real purchase
   - [ ] Verify magic link email arrives
   - [ ] Test on different devices
   - [ ] Monitor Stripe dashboard for payments

## üêõ Common Issues

### "No email received"
- [ ] Check spam/junk folder
- [ ] Verify FROM_EMAIL is verified in SendGrid
- [ ] Check SendGrid activity feed: https://app.sendgrid.com/email_activity
- [ ] Ensure you entered the correct email during purchase

### "No purchase found for this email"
- [ ] Wait 30 seconds after payment (Stripe needs to process)
- [ ] Check email matches exactly (case-sensitive)
- [ ] Verify payment in Stripe dashboard: https://dashboard.stripe.com/payments
- [ ] Ensure `courseId` matches in both article and Stripe metadata

### "Rate limit hit"
- [ ] Wait 1 hour (rate limits reset)
- [ ] Or adjust rate limit in code (see Customization section above)

### Functions not working
- [ ] Ensure Netlify CLI is running: `npx netlify dev` (not just `hugo server`)
- [ ] Check function logs in terminal for errors
- [ ] Verify all environment variables are set in `.env`

### Session not persisting
- [ ] Check if localStorage is enabled in browser
- [ ] Check browser console for errors (F12)
- [ ] Try clearing cache and cookies
