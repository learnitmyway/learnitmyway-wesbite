Edit `.env` and add your Stripe secret key:
```
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_actual_key_here
URL=http://localhost:8888
```

### 3. Start Development Server

npx netlify dev
```

## How Users Experience It

### First Time Purchase

1. User visits premium article â†’ Sees preview + paywall
2. Clicks "Purchase via Stripe" â†’ Enters email
3. Redirects to Stripe checkout
4. Completes payment (secure on Stripe's site)
5. Redirects back â†’ Content is unlocked!

### Returning / Other Device

1. User visits premium article on different device
2. Clicks "Verify access"
3. Enters their email
4. System checks Stripe â†’ Unlocks content

**No passwords to remember!** Just use the email from purchase.

## Creating Premium Content

### Make Any Article Premium

Add to front matter:

```yaml
---
title: "My Premium Article"
isPremium: true
courseId: "my-unique-id"
priceUSD: 29
---

Preview text here (visible to everyone).

<!--more-->

Premium content here (requires payment).
```

That's it!

---

## Key Differences from Previous Implementation

| Previous (JWT) | Current (Stripe) |
|----------------|------------------|
| Complex token system | Simple email verification |
| Simulated purchases | Real Stripe payments |
| In-memory storage | Stripe stores everything |
| JWT library needed | Just Stripe SDK |
| 3 functions | 2 functions |
| More code | Less code |
| Token management | No tokens |

---

## Production Deployment

### Netlify Environment Variables

Go to: **Site settings â†’ Environment variables**

Add:
```
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = sk_live_your_live_key
URL = https://yoursite.com
```

### Switch to Live Keys

1. In Stripe dashboard, get your **live** keys
2. Update environment variable in Netlify
3. That's it - you're live!

---

## Costs

**Stripe Fees:**
- 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction
- No monthly fees
- No setup fees

**Example:** $29 article = You get $27.66 after fees

**Netlify Functions:**
- Free tier: 125,000 requests/month
- After that: $25 per 1M requests

---

## Security

âœ… **Payment data never touches your server** - Handled by Stripe  
âœ… **No user passwords to manage** - Email-based verification  
âœ… **No database to secure** - Stripe stores everything  
âœ… **Content in HTML** - Technically accessible (like Medium paywall)  

For most use cases, this level of security is perfectly fine. Honest people will pay, dishonest people will always find a way around any system.
